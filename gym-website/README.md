## Disclamer ❗️

A word of disclaimer, I may have made some changes to it or added other content, but the code is not completely original!
I am simply a student passionate about Front-end and the intersection of code and design, I always try to do courses and projects during my free time, so I must warn you that this code is NOT ORIGINAL.
